# MRExtensionMethods

This repository contains a number of extension methods I frequently use for Unity.
Some could be useful to others, some are oddly specific and probably shouldn't be here...

The extensions are currently organized into the following categories:

+ GameObjects
+ IEnumerators
+ Lists
+ Vectors
+ Miscellaneous

See the various .cs files for what is available.
